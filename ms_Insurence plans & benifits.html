    <h3>What is Health Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Health insurance is a financial product that provides coverage for medical expenses incurred due to illnesses, injuries, or other health-related issues. It helps individuals and families manage the costs associated with healthcare, such as hospital stays, surgeries, medications, and preventive services. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The process generally involves selecting a suitable insurance plan, paying regular premiums, and filing claims for any eligible medical expenses incurred during the coverage period. By securing health insurance, individuals gain peace of mind, knowing they have financial support in case of unexpected medical events.
